follow the tutorial here http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html but the tutorial is for windows user. This repository is for linux user.

the character '#' at the beginning of each line stand for command that go into bash.  
the character '//' stand for comment

requirement : bochs (program used for emulate i386 machine) , nasm (used in this repository for compiling assembly code into machine code() )
#sudo yum install bochs 
#sudo yum install nasm
or
#sudo apt-get install bochs 
#sudo apt-get install nasm

(file) .bochsrc
configuration file for bochs, in this commit it contain configuation for a floppy disk to emulate and point to floppy3.img file

(file) bootloader.nasm 
assembly code to put into the bootloader

(file) bootloader.bin
16 bit raw binary file that are compiled from bootloader.nasm.
#nasm -f bin -o bootloader.bin bootloader.nasm

(file) my/tool/create_write_a_file.c
source code to copy n byte from a file to overwrite at a specific location of another file. see an example below for what this do 
(example) {
	(file1) contain text  (aaaaa)  (file2) contain text  (bbbbbbbbbb)
	#./create_write_a_file --file1 file1 --file2 file2 --start1 1 --start2 1 --end1 3 --end2 3
	(file1) contain text  (aaaaa)  (file2) contain text  (baaabbbbbb)
	}

(file) create_write_a_file
execuble file
#gcc -o create_write_a_file create_write_a_file.c

(file) floppy3.img
this file contain an image of an bootable floppy disk 
here are the step to create this file and load binary into this file to make it bootable and have a fat12 file system 
#dd -if=/dev/zero -of=floppy3.img bs=512 count=2048   //this command copy 1.44Mb contain 0 into floppy3.img
#losetup /dev/loop0 floppy3.img     //load the image into loopback device. this mean you can use /dev/loop0 as a floppy device.
#./create_write_a_file --file1 bootloader.bin --file2 floppy3.img --start1 0 --start2 0 --end1 511 --end2 511 	//copy 512 byte from bootloader.bin -> floppy3.img to format the floppy disk using fat12 file system
#mount -t msdos -o loop,fat=12,umask=0,check=strict /dev/loop0 /mountpoint/  	// now you create a mount point for the floppy disk file system. if you write into this file system the floppy3.img will change accordingly as if you have a real floppy disk.

boot the emulator bochs
#bochs   // pick number 6 (begin to emulate, and you have your first os)

also these command for umount and losetup
#sudo umount /dev/loop0
#sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
